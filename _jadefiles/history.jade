            | Throughout the last 1.5 years of my collegiate career I joined the BYU Mars Rover team, and contributed to the design of a full mock-Mars Rover to compete in an international competition (URC). My senior year I acted as the BYU Mars Rover Team Lead, providing leadership and direction to a team of 28 student engineers. Outside of BYU Mars Rover, I was also involved in the BYU Rocketry Club, BYU China Conference, YServe and more on-campus groups.

            | I have more than 3.5 years of International Work, Volunteer, and Education experience in Mainland China and Taiwan. Most recently, I participated in the U.S. State Department's Chinese Flagship program as a Gilman scholar, spending 1 year at Nanjing University studying Mandarin and Engineering, as well as participating in an internship. This experience has led me to become fluent in Mandarin, become a certified Interpreter, and score a Superior on the Oral Proficiency Test (OPI)
